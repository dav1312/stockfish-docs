It is our pleasure to release Stockfish 13 to chess fans worldwide. As
usual, downloads are freely available at

[stockfishchess.org/download/](https://stockfishchess.org/download/)

The Stockfish project builds on a thriving community of enthusiasts who
contribute their expertise, time, and resources to build a free and
open-source chess engine that is robust, widely available, and very
strong. We would like to thank them all!

The good news first: from now on, our users can expect more frequent
high-quality releases of Stockfish! Sadly, this decision has been
triggered by the start of sales of the Fat Fritz 2 engine by ChessBase,
which is a copy of a very recent development version of Stockfish with
minor modifications. We refer to our [statement on Fat Fritz
2](https://blog.stockfishchess.org/post/643239805544792064/statement-on-fat-fritz-2)
and [a community
blog](https://lichess.org/blog/YCvy7xMAACIA8007/fat-fritz-2-is-a-rip-off)
for further information.

This version of Stockfish is significantly stronger than any of its
predecessors. Stockfish 13 outperforms Stockfish 12 [by at least 35
Elo](https://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/602bcccf7f517a561bc49b11).
When playing against a one-year-old Stockfish, it [wins 60 times more
game pairs than it
loses](https://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests/view/600fbb9c735dd7f0f0352d59).
This release features an NNUE network retrained on billions of
positions, much faster network evaluation code, and significantly
improved search heuristics, as well as additional evaluation tweaks. In
the course of its development, this version has won the superfinals of
the TCEC Season 19 and TCEC Season 20.

Going forward, the Leela Chess Zero and Stockfish teams will join forces
to demonstrate our commitment to open source chess engines and training
tools, and open data. We are convinced that our free and open-source
chess engines serve the chess community very well.

Stay safe and enjoy chess!

The Stockfish team
