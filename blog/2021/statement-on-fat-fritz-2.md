Stockfish is an open-source project, sharing and freely distributing the
code, tools and data needed to deliver this chess engine. We do this
because we are convinced that open software and open data are key
ingredients to make rapid progress, and thus for the benefit of our
users. The recent progress in playing strength of Stockfish confirms the
path taken. We proudly provide the tools for free chess analysis to
millions of users, with countless titled players using Stockfish for
their preparation. Be assured that free engines will serve you well!

Recently, ChessBase has started distribution and sales of the Fat Fritz
2 chess engine. This chess engine is a Stockfish derivative, with a few
lines of code modification (engine name, authors list and a few
parameters), and a new set of NNUE net weights considered proprietary.
ChessBase's communication on Fat Fritz 2, claiming originality where
there is none, has [shocked our
community](https://twitter.com/tordr/status/1359428424255823875).
Furthermore, the engine Fat Fritz 2 fails to convince on [independent
rating lists](https://www.sp-cc.de/), casting doubt on the usefulness of
those modifications. Indeed, we feel that customers buying Fat Fritz 2
get very little added value for money. Claims to the contrary appear
misleading.

Selling Stockfish derivatives is possible with the GPLv3 license we
grant, but not without requirements. In particular, the license states
that if one redistributes a program derived from our work, the
corresponding modifications of our sources and all information needed to
build that program must be made available. Only after explicitly
informing Albert Silver (the author of the net in Fat Fritz 2) of a
license violation have matching C++ sources, but not the net weights,
been made available. Obviously, we condemn the approach taken.
